# Codecademy project - Jammming (with YouTube API)

In this app, you will be able to search for videos matching a particular title, and save those videos into a playlist.

This project is created for Codecademy's [Jammming project](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-front-end-development/tracks/fscj-22-react-part-ii/modules/wdcp-22-jammming-54dd6aa4-39da-42be-989f-67a12f65b1a8/kanban_projects/jammming-react18) after their React course's redesign. Instead of using the Spotify API, this project will use the YouTube API.
